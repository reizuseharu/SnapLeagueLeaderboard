- Any more DQs count for 0 points and 1 race
- In case of tie:
    - League Placement: Shared
    - Tournament Placement: [Jynx%](#jynx-rules) tiebreaker or race off between tied contestants to decide final placement

### Jynx% Rules

These rules apply only if one person in a particular 1v1 race has a Jynx% run (no Cloyster in river (must show all 3 end Shellders))

- 20 (?) second time subtraction
    - Attempt to alleviate race based losses from RNG
- Also works as tiebreaker -- must count

### Group rules

- Minimum 3 entries
- Points dependent on amount of racers
    - Winner gets (# of racers) points, then decrease by 2 for 2nd place, and decrease by 1 for all other racers
    - e.g.
        - 2 person race: Winner get 2 points, last gets 0 points
        - 3 person race: Winner get 3 points, 2nd gets 1 point, last gets 0 points
        - 4 person race: Winner get 4 points, 2nd gets 2 points, 3rd gets 1 points, last get 0 points
        - 5 person race: Winner get 5 points, 2nd gets 3 points, 3rd gets 2 points, 4th gets 1 point, last get 0 points
        - 6 person race: Winner get 6 points, 2nd gets 4 points, 3rd gets 3 points, 4th gets 2 points, 5th gets 1 point, last gets 0 points
- If tie, share the same placement and points

### 1v1 rules

- Winners get 3 points for a win, 0 for a loss (exceptions apply: [Jynx%](#jynx-rules))
- [Jynx%](#jynx-rules)
    - If after time subtraction ahead of opponent:
        - When previously behind: winner gets 2 points, loser gets 1 point
        - When previously ahead: winner gets 4 points, loser gets 0 points (i.e. Jynx% win is worth 4 points)
